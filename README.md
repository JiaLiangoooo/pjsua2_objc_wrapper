# PJSIP - Objective-C Wrapper

First and foremost, see http://www.pjsip.org for details on the pjsip project.

This project currently provides a stable wrapper for pjsip 2.2.1.
The interesting / helpful classes reside in the Facades folder.

After building the libraries and including the pjsip header files, you can use this project to provide a highlevel Objective-C wrapper of the PJSIP C++ API.
